# TaskScedulerCF7
This is my final project for CF7. It is a task scheduling application running server side. Using it you can create your own tasks and notes in order to keep track of your assignments.


-How to build the application:

1. Create a VM: ```python -m venv venv```
2. Activate ```venv\Scripts\Activate``` -> (venv) appears
3. Install Flask: ```pip install flask```
4. Run Server: ```python app.py```
